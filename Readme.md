## Voxel Global Illumination

### 1.0. Overview

VXGI (or Voxel Cone Tracing) is a global illumination technique developed by NVIDIA, originally [published](https://research.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/publications/GIVoxels-pg2011-authors.pdf) in 2011. Later when the Maxwell architecture (GTX-900 series) released, the implementation was improved using GPU specific features starting from that generation. I'll show how to use those in a bit.

The basic idea of VXGI is:
1. Voxelize the scene
2. Cone Trace voxelized scene for second bounce lighting

The voxelized representation is an approximation of the actual scene and Cone Tracing is an approximation of actual Ray Tracing.
Trading accuracy for speed! Still, VXGI has the potential to naturally account for various lighting effects. Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/5m9fOVWaqdE) showcasing some of them.
I think it's a great technique to implement in a hobby renderer, since it's conceptually easy to understand, gives decent results and you get to play with advanced OpenGL features!

### 2.0 Voxelization

![Voxelized Sponza](Screenshots/Articles/VoxelizedSponza.png?raw=true)

This is a visualization of a 384-sized `rgba16f`-format 3D texture. It's the output of the voxelization stage. Every pixel/voxel is shaded normally using some basic lighting and classic shadow maps. I only have this single texture, but others might store additional information such as normals for multiple bounces. The voxelization happens using a single shader program. A basic vertex shader and a rather unusal but clever fragment shader.

#### Vertex Shader
There are two variables `vec3: GridMin, GridMax`.
Those define the world space region which the voxel grid spans over. When rendering, triangles get transformed to world space like normally and then mapped from the range `[GridMin, GridMax]` to `[-1, 1]` (normalized device coordinates).
Triangles outside the grid will not be voxelized.
You can do this mapping yourself or use an orthographic projection.
As the grid grows, voxel resolution decreases. 

```glsl
#version 460 core
layout(location = 0) in vec3 Position;

uniform mat4 VoxelGridMatrix; // Matrix4.CreateOrthographicOffCenter(GridMin, GridMax)
out vec3 NormalizedDeviceCoords;

void main() {
    vec3 fragPos = (ModelMatrix * vec4(Position, 1.0)).xyz;

    // transform fragPos from [GridMin, GridMax] to [-1, 1]
    NormalizedDeviceCoords = (VoxelGridMatrix * fragPos).xyz;

    gl_Position = vec4(NormalizedDeviceCoords, 1.0);
}
```

#### Fragment Shader

We won't have any color attachments. In fact there is no FBO at all.
We will write into the 3D texture manually using OpenGL [image store](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Image_Load_Store).
Framebuffers are avoided because you can only ever attach a single texture-layer for rendering.
Image store works on absolute integer coordinates, so to find the corresponding voxel position we can transform the normalized device coordinates.

```glsl
#version 460 core
layout(binding = 0, rgba16f) restrict uniform image3D ImgVoxels;

in vec3 NormalizedDeviceCoords;

void main()  {
    vec3 uvw = NormalizedDeviceCoords * 0.5 + 0.5; // transform from [-1, 1] to [0, 1]
    ivec3 voxelPos = ivec3(uvw * imageSize(ImgVoxels)); // transform from [0, 1] to [0, imageSize() - 1]

    vec3 voxelColor = ...; // compute some basic lighting
    imageStore(ImgVoxels, voxelPos, vec4(voxelColor, 1.0));
}
```

---

Since we don't have any color or depth attachments we want to use an [empty framebuffer](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Framebuffer_Object#Empty_framebuffers). It's used to explicitly communicate OpenGL the render width & height, which normally is derived from the color attachments. To not miss triangles, face culling is off. Color and other writes are turned off implicitly by using the empty framebuffer. Clearing is done by a simple compute shader.

Now, running the voxelization as described so far gives me this. There are two obvious issues that I'll address.

![Voxelization Attempt](Screenshots/Articles/VoxelizationAttempt.gif)

### 2.1 Fixing flickering

Flickering happens because the world space position for different fragment shader invocations can get mapped to the same voxel, and the invocation that writes to the image at last is random. One decent solution is to store the `max()` of the already stored and the new voxel color. There are several ways to implement this in a thread-safe manner: Fragment Shader Interlock, CAS-Loop, Atomic Operations.
Fragment Shader Interlock is only available on NVIDIA & Intel. CAS-Loop is what I've seen the most but it's unstable and slow.
So I decided to go with `imageAtomicMax`.

```glsl
layout(binding = 0, rgba16f) restrict uniform image3D ImgVoxels;
layout(binding = 1, r32ui) restrict uniform uimage3D ImgVoxelsR;
layout(binding = 2, r32ui) restrict uniform uimage3D ImgVoxelsG;
layout(binding = 3, r32ui) restrict uniform uimage3D ImgVoxelsB;

void main() {
    uvec3 uintVoxelColor = floatBitsToUint(voxelColor);
    imageAtomicMax(ImgVoxelsR, voxelPos, uintVoxelColor.r);
    imageAtomicMax(ImgVoxelsG, voxelPos, uintVoxelColor.g);
    imageAtomicMax(ImgVoxelsB, voxelPos, uintVoxelColor.b);
    imageStore(ImgVoxels, voxelPos, vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0));
}
```

Image atomics can only be performed on single channel integer formats, but the voxel texture is required to be at least `rgba16f`. So I create three additional `r32ui`-format intermediate textures to perform the atomic operations on. Alpha is just always set to 1.0, no atomic operations needed. After voxelization, in a simple compute shader, they get merged into the final `rgba16f` texture.

### 2.2 Fixing missing voxels

Why are there so many missing voxels? Consider the floor. What do we see if we view it from the side.

![Plane From Side](Screenshots/Articles/PlaneFromSide.png?raw=true)

Well, there is a thin line, but technically even that shouldn't be visible. When this gets rasterized the [voxelization fragment shader](#fragment-shader) won't even run.
The camera should have been looking along the Y axis, not Z, because this is the dominant axis that maximizes the amount of projected area (more fragment shader invocations). The [voxelization vertex shader](#vertex-shader) doesn't have a view matrix and adding one would be overkill. To make the "camera" look a certain axis we can simply swizzle the vertex positions.

This is typically implemented in a geometry shader by finding the dominant axis of the triangle's geometric normal and then swizzling the vertex positions accordingly. Geometry shaders are known to be very slow, so I went with a different approach.

```glsl
uniform int RenderAxis; // Set to 0, 1, 2 for each draw

void main() {
    gl_Position = vec4(NormalizedDeviceCoords, 1.0);

    if (RenderAxis == 0) gl_Position = gl_Position.zyxw;
    if (RenderAxis == 1) gl_Position = gl_Position.xzyw;
}
```

The entire scene simply gets rendered 3 times, once from each axis. No geometry shader is used. This works great together with `imageAtomicMax` from [2.2 Fixing missing voxels](#22-fixing-missing-voxels), since the fragment shader doesn't just overwrite a voxel's color each draw.

Performance comparison on 11 million triangles [Intel Sponza](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/topic-technology/graphics-research/samples.html) scene with AMD RX 5700 XT, only measuring the actual voxelization program:

* 5.3 ms without geometry shader (rendering thrice method)
* 10.5 ms with geometry shader (rendering once method)

The rendering thrice method is simpler to implement and faster. Still it's far from optimal. For example swizzling the vertices in a compute shader and then rendering only once, basically emulating the geometry shader, would likely be more performant.

### 2.3 Optimizations (using NV-extensions)

There are certain extensions we can use to improve the voxelization process. These are only supported on NVIDIA GPUs starting from the Maxwell architecture (GTX-900 series).

#### GL_NV_shader_atomic_fp16_vector
This extensions is used to improve the implementation discussed in [2.1 Fixing flickering](#21-fixing-flickering).

It allows to perform atomics on `rgba16f`-format images. This means the three `r32ui`-format intermediate textures and the compute shader that merges them into the final voxel texture are no longer needed. Instead we can directly perform `imageAtomicMax` on the voxel texture.

```glsl
#version 460 core
#extension GL_NV_shader_atomic_fp16_vector : require
layout(binding = 0, rgba16f) restrict uniform image3D ImgVoxels;

void main() {
    imageAtomicMax(ImgResult, voxelPos, f16vec4(voxelColor, 1.0));
}
```

#### GL_NV_geometry_shader_passthrough + GL_NV_viewport_swizzle
These extensions are used to improve the implementation discussed in [2.2 Fixing missing voxels](#22-fixing-missing-voxels)

What if the geometry shader wasn't painfully slow? Then we could actually use it instead of rendering the scene 3 times.
Fortunately, `GL_NV_geometry_shader_passthrough` allows exactly that. The extension limits the abilities of normal geometry shaders, but it lets the hardware implement them with minimal overhead. One limitation is that you can no longer modify vertex positions of the primitive. So how are we going to do per vertex swizzling then? With `GL_NV_viewport_swizzle`. The extension allows associating a swizzle with a viewport.
```glsl
#version 460 core
#extension GL_NV_geometry_shader_passthrough : require

layout(triangles) in;
layout(passthrough) in gl_PerVertex {
    vec4 gl_Position;
} gl_in[];

layout(passthrough) in InOutVars {
    // in & out variables...
} inData[];

void main() {
    vec3 p1 = gl_in[1].gl_Position.xyz - gl_in[0].gl_Position.xyz;
    vec3 p2 = gl_in[2].gl_Position.xyz - gl_in[0].gl_Position.xyz;
    vec3 normalWeights = abs(cross(p1, p2));

    int dominantAxis = normalWeights.y > normalWeights.x ? 1 : 0;
    dominantAxis = normalWeights.z > normalWeights[dominantAxis] ? 2 : dominantAxis;

    // Swizzle is applied by selecting a viewport
    // This works using the GL_NV_viewport_swizzle extension
    gl_ViewportIndex = 2 - dominantAxis;
}
```

This is like a standard voxelization geometry shader. It finds the axis from which the triangle should be rendered to maximize projected area and then applies the swizzle accordingly. Except that the swizzle is applied indirectly using `GL_NV_viewport_swizzle` and the geometry shader is written using `GL_NV_geometry_shader_passthrough`. How to associate a particular swizzle with a viewport is an exercise left to the reader :).

Even though the RTX 3050 Ti Laptop is a less powerful GPU we can make it voxelize faster and take up less memory in the process by using the extensions.

### 3.0 Cone Tracing

TODO

## Variable Rate Shading

### 1.0 Overview

Variable Rate Shading is when you render different regions of the framebuffer at different resolutions. This feature is exposed in OpenGL through the [`NV_shading_rate_image`](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/extensions/NV/NV_shading_rate_image.txt) extension. When drawing the hardware fetches a "Shading Rate Image" looks up the value in a user defined shading rate palette and applies that shading rate to the block of fragments.

So all we need to do is generate this Shading Rate Image which is really just a `r8ui`-format texture where each pixel covers
a 16x16 tile of the framebuffer. This image will control the resolution at which each tile is rendered.

Example of a generated Shading Rate Image while the camera is rapidly moving forward, taking into account velocity and variance of luminance
![ShadingRateImage](Screenshots/Articles/ShadingRateImage.png?raw=true)

Red stands for 1 invocation per 4x4 pixels which means 16x less fragment shader invocations in those regions.
No color is the default - 1 invocation per pixel.

### 2.0 Shading Rate Image generation

The ultimate goal of the algorithm should be to apply a as low as possible shading rate without the user noticing. I assume the following are cases where we can safely reduce the shading rate:

* High average magnitude of velocity
* Low variance of luminance

This makes sense as you can generally see less detail in fast moving things. And if the luminance is roughly the same across a tile (which is what the variance tells you) there is not much detail to begin with.

In both cases we need the average of some value over all 256 pixels.

Average is defined as:

$$\overline{x} = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \frac{1}{n} \cdot x_{i}$$

Where $\overline{x}$ is the average of $x$ and $n$ the number of elements.

For starters you could call `atomicAdd(SharedMem, value * (1.0 / n))` on shared memory, but atomics on floats is not a core feature and, as far as my testing goes, the following approach was no slower:
```glsl
#define TILE_SIZE 16
layout(local_size_x = TILE_SIZE, local_size_y = TILE_SIZE, local_size_z = 1) in;

const float AVG_MULTIPLIER = 1.0 / (TILE_SIZE * TILE_SIZE);
shared float Average[TILE_SIZE * TILE_SIZE];
void main()
{
    Average[gl_LocalInvocationIndex] = GetSpeed() * AVG_MULTIPLIER;
    for (int cutoff = (TILE_SIZE * TILE_SIZE) / 2; cutoff > 0; cutoff /= 2)
    {
        if (gl_LocalInvocationIndex < cutoff)
        {
            Average[gl_LocalInvocationIndex] += Average[cutoff + gl_LocalInvocationIndex];
        }
        barrier();
    }
    // average is computed and stored in Average[0]
}
```
This algorithm first loads all the values we want to average into shared memory.
Then it adds the first half of array entries to the other half, storing results in the first half. After that, all the new values are again divided and added together. The output is now 1/4 the size of the original array. At some point, the final sum is collapsed into the first element.

That's it for the averaging part.

Calculating the variance requires a little more work.
What we actually want is the [Coefficient of variation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_variation) (CV), because that is normalized and independent of scale (e.g {5, 10} and {10, 20} have same CV = ~0.33). But the two are related - variance is needed to compute CV.

The CV equals standard deviation divided by the average. And standard deviation is just the square root of variance.

$$V(x) = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(x_{i} - \overline{x})^{2}}{n}$$

<!-- fix error of proceeding formula not rendering properly -->
&nbsp;

$$StdDev(x) = \sqrt{V(x)}$$

<!-- fix error of proceeding formula not rendering properly -->
&nbsp;

$$CV = \frac{StdDev(x)}{\overline{x}}$$


Here is an implementation. I put the parallel adding stuff from above in the function `ParallelSum`.
```glsl
#define TILE_SIZE 16
layout(local_size_x = TILE_SIZE, local_size_y = TILE_SIZE, local_size_z = 1) in;

const float AVG_MULTIPLIER = 1.0 / (TILE_SIZE * TILE_SIZE);

void main()
{
    float pixelLuminance = GetLuminance();

    float tileAvgLuminance = ParallelSum(pixelLuminance * AVG_MULTIPLIER);
    float tileLuminanceVariance = ParallelSum(pow(pixelLuminance - tileAvgLuminance, 2.0) * AVG_MULTIPLIER);

    if (gl_LocalInvocationIndex == 0)
    {
        float stdDev = sqrt(tileLuminanceVariance);
        float coeffOfVariation = stdDev / tileAvgLuminance;

        // use coeffOfVariation as a measure of "how different are the luminance values to each other"
    }
}
```

At this point, you can use both the average speed and the Coefficient of variation of the luminance to get an appropriate shading rate. That is not the most interesting part.
I decided to scale both of these factors, add them together and then use that to mix between different rates. The code is [here](https://github.com/BoyBaykiller/IDKEngine/blob/master/IDKEngine/res/shaders/ShadingRateClassification/compute.glsl).

### 3.0 Subgroup optimizations

While operating on shared memory is fast, Subgroup Intrinsics are faster.
They are a relatively new topic on its own and you almost never see them mentioned in the context of OpenGL. The subgroup is an implementation dependent set of invocations in which data can be shared efficiently. There are many subgroup operations. The whole thing is document [here](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/GLSL/blob/master/extensions/khr/GL_KHR_shader_subgroup.txt), but vendor specific/arb extensions with `ARB_shader_group_vote` actually being part of core also exist.
Anyway, the one that is particularly interesting for our case of computing a sum is `KHR_shader_subgroup_arithmetic`, or more specifically the `subgroupAdd` function.

On my GPU a subgroup is 32 invocations big.
When I call `subgroupAdd(2)` the function will return 64.
So it does a sum over all values passed to the function in the scope of all (active) subgroup invocations.

Using this knowledge, my optimized version of a workgroup wide sum looks like this:
```glsl
#define SUBGROUP_SIZE __subroupSize__
#extension GL_KHR_shader_subgroup_arithmetic : require

layout(local_size_x = 256, local_size_y = 1, local_size_z = 1) in;

shared float SharedSums[gl_WorkGroupSize.x / SUBGROUP_SIZE];
void main()
{
    float subgroupSum = subgroupAdd(GetValueToAdd());

    // single invocation of the subgroup should write result
    // into shared mem for further workgroup wide processing
    if (subgroupElect())
    {
        SharedSums[gl_SubgroupID] = subgroupSum;
    }
    barrier();

    // finally add up all sums previously computed by the subgroups in this workgroup
    for (int cutoff = gl_NumSubgroups / 2; cutoff > 0; cutoff /= 2)
    {
        if (gl_LocalInvocationIndex < cutoff)
        {
            SharedSums[gl_LocalInvocationIndex] += SharedSums[cutoff + gl_LocalInvocationIndex];
        }
        barrier();
    }

    // average is computed and stored in SharedSums[0]
}
```
Note how the workgroup expands the size of a subgroup, so we still have to use shared memory to obtain a workgroup wide result.
However in the for loop it now only has to iterate through `log2(gl_NumSubgroups / 2)` values instead of `log2(gl_WorkGroupSize.x / 2)`.

## Point Shadows

### 1.0 Rendering

In core OpenGL geometry shaders are the only stage where you can write to `gl_Layer`. This variable specifies which layer of the framebuffer attachment to render to.
There is a common approach to point shadow rendering where
instead of: 
```cs
for (int face = 0; face < 6; face++)
{
    NamedFramebufferTextureLayer(fbo, attachment, cubemap, level, face);
    // Render Scene into <face>th face of cubemap
    RenderScene();
}
```
you do:

```cs
RenderScene();
```
```glsl
void main()
{
    for (int face = 0; face < 6; face++)
    {
        gl_Layer = face;
        OutputTriangle();
    }
}
```
Notice how instead of calling `NamedFramebufferTextureLayer` from the CPU we set `gl_Layer` inside a geometry shader saving us 5 draw calls and driver overhead.

So this should be faster right?

No. At least not on my RX 580 and RX 5700 XT. And I assume its not much different on NVIDIA since geometry shaders are slow except on Intel.

There are multiple extensions which allow you to set `gl_Layer` from a vertex shader.
`ARB_shader_viewport_layer_array` for example reads:
> In order to use any viewport or attachment layer other than zero, a
> geometry shader must be present. Geometry shaders introduce processing
> overhead and potential performance issues. The `AMD_vertex_shader_layer`
> and `AMD_vertex_shader_viewport_index` extensions allowed the `gl_Layer`
> and `gl_ViewportIndex` outputs to be written directly from the vertex shader
> with no geometry shader present.
> This extension effectively merges ...

So what I ended up doing is either use vertex layered rendering if any of the required extensions is available and otherwise just do 6 draw calls without invoking any geometry shader since that is slower.

The way you might do vertex layered rendering looks like this:
```cs
RenderSceneInstanced(count: 6);
```

```glsl
#extension GL_ARB_shader_viewport_layer_array : enable
#extension GL_AMD_vertex_shader_layer : enable
#extension GL_NV_viewport_array2 : enable
#define HAS_VERTEX_LAYERED_RENDERING (GL_ARB_shader_viewport_layer_array || GL_NV_viewport_array2 || GL_AMD_vertex_shader_layer)

void main()
{
#if HAS_VERTEX_LAYERED_RENDERING
    gl_Layer = gl_InstanceID;
    gl_Position = PointShadow.FaceMatrices[gl_Layer] * Positon;
#else
    // fallback
#endif
}
```
Since vertex shaders can't generate vertices like geometry shader we'll use a instanced draw command to tell OpenGL to render every vertex 6 times. Inside the shader we can then use the current instance (`gl_InstanceID`) as the face to render to.

### 2.0 Sampling

Just want to mention that OpenGL provides useful shadow sampler types like `samplerCubeShadow` or `sampler2DShadow`.
When using shadow samplers, texture lookup functions accept an additional parameter with which the depth value in the texture
is compared. The returned value is no longer the depth value, but instead a visibility ratio in the range of [0, 1].
When using linear filtering the comparison is evaluated and averaged for a 2x2 block of pixels.
And all that in one function!

To configure a texture such that it can be sampled by a shadow sampler, you can do this:
```cs
GL.TextureParameter(texture, TextureParameterName.TextureCompareMode, (int)TextureCompareMode.CompareRefToTexture);
GL.TextureParameter(texture, TextureParameterName.TextureCompareFunc, (int)All.Less);
```
And sample it in glsl like that:
```glsl
layout(binding = 0) uniform samplerCubeShadow ShadowTexture;

void main()
{
    float fragDepth = GetDepthRange0_1(); 
    float visibility = texture(ShadowTexture, vec3(coords, fragDepth));
}
```

Here is a comparison of using shadow samplers (right) vs not using them.
![Sampling Comparison](Screenshots/Articles/SamplingComparison.png?raw=true)

Of course, you can combine this with software filtering like PCF to get even better results.

## GPU Driven Rendering

### 1.0 Multi Draw Indirect

All Multi Draw Indirects internally just call another non multi draw command `drawcount` times.
In the case of `MultiDrawElementsIndirect` this underyling draw call is `DrawElementsInstancedBaseVertexBaseInstance`.
This effectively allows multiple meshes to be drawn with one API call, reducing driver overhead.

Arguments for these underlying draw calls are provided by us and expected to have the following format:
```cs
struct DrawElementsCmd
{
    int Count; // indices count
    int InstanceCount; // number of instances
    int FirstIndex; // offset in indices array
    int BaseVertex; // offset in vertex array
    int BaseInstance; // sets the value of `gl_BaseInstance`. Only used by the API when doing old school instancing
}
```
The `DrawCommand`s are not supplied through the draw function itself as usual, but have to be put into a buffer (hence "Indirect" suffix) which is then bound
to `GL_DRAW_INDIRECT_BUFFER` before drawing.
So to render 5 meshes you'd have to configure 5 `DrawCommand` and load them into the said buffer.

The final draw could then be as simple as:
```cs
public void Draw()
{
    vao.Bind(); // contains merged vertex and indices array + vertex format
    drawCommandBuffer.Bind(BufferTarget.DrawIndirectBuffer); // contains DrawCommand[Meshes.Length]

    GL.MultiDrawElementsIndirect(PrimitiveType.Triangles, DrawElementsType.UnsignedInt, IntPtr.Zero, Meshes.Length, 0);
}
```
While this renders all geometry just fine, you might be wondering how to access the entirety of materials to compute proper shading. After all scenes like Sponza come with a lot of textures and the usual method of manually declaring `sampler2D` in glsl quickly becomes insufficient as we can't do state changes between draw calls anymore (which is good) to swap out materials. This is where Bindless Textures comes in.

### 2.0 Bindless Textures

First of all `ARB_bindless_texture` is not a core extension. Nevertheless, almost all AMD and NVIDIA GPUs implement it, as you can see [here](https://opengl.gpuinfo.org/listreports.php?extension=GL_ARB_bindless_texture). Unfortunately render doc doesn't support it.

The main idea behind bindless textures is the ability to generate a unique 64 bit handle from any texture, which can then be used to represent it inside glsl and thus no longer depend on previous state based mechanics.
Specifically, this means that you no longer call `BindTextureUnit` (or the older `ActiveTexture` + `BindTexture`) to bind a texture to a glsl texture unit.
Instead, generate a handle and somehow communicate it to the GPU (most likely with a buffer).

Example:
```cs
long handle = GL.Arb.GetTextureHandle(texture);
GL.Arb.MakeTextureHandleResident(handle);

GL.CreateBuffers(1, out int buffer);
GL.NamedBufferStorage(buffer, sizeof(long), ref handle, BufferStorageFlags.DynamicStorageBit);
GL.BindBufferBase(BufferRangeTarget.ShaderStorageBuffer, 0, buffer);
```
```glsl
#version 460 core
#extension GL_ARB_bindless_texture : require

layout(std430, binding = 0) restrict readonly buffer TextureSSBO
{
    sampler2D Textures[];
} textureSSBO;

void main()
{
    sampler2D myTexture = textureSSBO.Textures[0];
    vec4 color = texture(myTexture, coords);
}
```
Here we generate a handle, upload it into a buffer and then access it through a shader storage block which exposes the buffer to the shader.
After the handle is generated, the texture's state is immutable. This cannot be undone.
To sample a bindless texture it's handle must also be made resident.
The extension allows you to place `sampler2D` directly inside the shader storage block as shown. Note however that you could also do `uvec2 Textures[];` and then perform a cast like: `sampler2D myTexture = sampler2D(textureSSBO.Textures[0])`.

In the case of an MDI renderer as described in [1.0 Multi Draw Indirect](#10-multi-draw-indirect).
the process of fetching each mesh's texture would look something like this:
```glsl
#version 460 core
#extension GL_ARB_bindless_texture : require

layout(std430, binding = 0) restrict readonly buffer MaterialSSBO
{
    Material Materials[];
} materialSSBO;

layout(std430, binding = 1) restrict readonly buffer MeshSSBO
{
    Mesh Meshes[];
} meshSSBO;

void main()
{
    Mesh mesh = meshSSBO.Meshes[gl_DrawID];
    Material material = materialSSBO.Materials[mesh.MaterialIndex];

    vec4 albedo = texture(material.Albedo, coords);
}
```
`gl_DrawID` is in the range of [0, drawcount - 1] and identifies the current sub draw inside a multi draw. And each sub draw corresponds to a mesh.
`Material` is just a struct containing one or more bindless textures.

There is one caveat (not exclusive to bindless textures), which is that they must be indexed with a [dynamically uniform expression](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Core_Language_(GLSL)#Dynamically_uniform_expression). Fortunately `gl_DrawID` is defined to satisfy this requirement.

### 3.0 Frustum Culling

Frustum culling is the process of identifying objects outside a camera frustum and then avoiding unnecessary computations for them.
I find the following implementation to be quite elegant and low overhead because it fits perfectly into the whole GPU driven rendering thing.

The ingredients needed to get started are:
- A projection + view matrix
- Buffer containing each mesh's model matrix
- Buffer containing each mesh's draw command
- Buffer containing each mesh's bounding box

In an MDI renderer as described in [1.0 Multi Draw Indirect](#10-multi-draw-indirect), the first three points are required anyway.
And getting a local space bounding box from each mesh's vertices shouldn't be a problem.

Remember how `MultiDrawElementsIndirect` reads draw commands from a buffer object?
That means the GPU can modify it's own drawing parameters by writing into this buffer object (using shader storage blocks).
And that's the key to GPU accelerated frustum culling without any CPU readback.

Basically, the CPU side of things is as simple this:
```cs
void Render()
{
    // Frustum Culling
    frustumCullingProgram.Use();
    GL.DispatchCompute((Meshes.Length + 64 - 1) / 64, 1, 1);
    GL.MemoryBarrier(MemoryBarrierFlags.CommandBarrierBit);

    // Drawing
    drawingProgram.Use();
    vao.Bind(); 
    drawCommandBuffer.Bind(BufferTarget.DrawIndirectBuffer);
    GL.MultiDrawElementsIndirect(PrimitiveType.Triangles, DrawElementsType.UnsignedInt, IntPtr.Zero, Meshes.Length, 0);
}
```
A compute shader is dispatched to do the culling and adjust the content of `drawCommandBuffer` accordingly.
The memory barrier ensures that at the point where `MultiDrawElementsIndirect` reads from `drawCommandBuffer` all previous
incoherent writes into to that buffer are visible.

Let's get to the culling shader:
```glsl
#version 460 core
layout(local_size_x = 64, local_size_y = 1, local_size_z = 1) in;

struct DrawElementsCmd
{
    uint Count;
    uint InstanceCount;
    uint FirstIndex;
    uint BaseVertex;
    uint BaseInstance;
};

layout(std430, binding = 0) restrict writeonly buffer DrawCommandsSSBO
{
    DrawCommand DrawCommands[];
} drawCommandSSBO;

void main()
{
    uint meshIndex = gl_GlobalInvocationID.x;
    if (meshIndex >= meshSSBO.Meshes.length())
        return;

    Mesh mesh = meshSSBO.Meshes[meshIndex];
    Box box = mesh.AABB;
        
    Frustum frustum = GetFrustum(ProjView * mesh.ModelMatrix);
    bool isMeshInFrustum = FrustumBoxIntersect(frustum, node.Min, node.Max);

    drawCommandSSBO.DrawCommands[meshIndex].InstanceCount = isMeshInFrustum ? 1 : 0;
}
```

Each thread grabs a mesh builds a frustum and then compares it against the aabb.
`drawCommandSSBO` holds the draw commands used by `MultiDrawElementsIndirect`.
If the test fails, `InstanceCount` is set to 0 otherwise 1.
A mesh with `InstanceCount = 0` will not cause any vertex shader invocations later when things are drawn, saving a lot of computations.
